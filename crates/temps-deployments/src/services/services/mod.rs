//! [`DeploymentService`]: deployments, their containers and their lifecycle.
//!
//! The service is defined here; its behaviour is split by concern:
//!
//! - `error`: [`DeploymentError`]
//! - `domains`: deployment and environment URLs, environment links, custom
//!   domains
//! - `queries`: deployment reads, captured container logs, jobs, activity and
//!   the row-to-DTO mapping
//! - `settings`: environment deployment settings and the static asset cache
//!   purge
//! - `containers`: container runtime per node, logs, listings, detail,
//!   start/stop/restart, env vars and metrics
//! - `cleanup`: owner cleanup of a deleted project's or environment's
//!   containers, and its ownership checks
//! - `guards`: the Docker-socket grant and external-hosting checks every deploy
//!   path runs
//! - `trigger`: manual pipeline and image deployment triggers
//! - `redeploy`: redeploys from the recorded source, node drain and failover
//!   planning
//! - `reuse`: what rollback and promotion share: the reused artifact, its image
//!   provenance, health and resources, static reuse completion and failure
//!   handling
//! - `rollback`: rollback to an earlier deployment of the same environment
//! - `promote`: promotion of a deployment's build into another environment
